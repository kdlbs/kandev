/**
 * Allowlist of paths the `i18next/no-literal-string` ERROR applies to.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT `components/**` + `app/**`. A repo-wide error means every PR
 * that lands a hardcoded string anywhere — including PRs that have nothing to do
 * with i18n — breaks. The first attempt at this migration shipped the global
 * form and spent two days in conflict-resolution rounds because `main` kept
 * moving underneath it.
 *
 * Instead the guard is opt-in per path, so it can only ever tighten:
 *
 *   - Migrating a page or directory? Externalize its strings, then append its
 *     path here in the SAME PR. That path is now permanently protected.
 *   - Everything not listed is unaffected, so unrelated PRs never see this rule
 *     and there is no treadmill.
 *
 * Entries may be single files or directory globs — use a file glob while a
 * directory is partially migrated, and collapse to `dir/**` once it is done.
 * The list only shrinks by mistake; adding to it is the whole point.
 *
 * A clean lint is NOT proof a path is fully migrated — the rule only sees plain
 * literals in JSX. Template literals, `confirm()`/`alert()` arguments, and copy
 * returned from plain `.ts` helpers are invisible to it. The pseudo-locale is
 * the completeness check. See docs/i18n.md.
