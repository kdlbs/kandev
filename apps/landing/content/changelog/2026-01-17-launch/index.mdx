## What is kandev.ai?

kandev.ai is a Kanban-native development platform that pairs task management with AI agents. Every task can be executed by an agent in a clean, isolated environment, while you keep control over approvals and merge decisions.

## Initial launch features

- **Kanban boards for engineering work** with task metadata, priorities, and agent selection.
- **Isolated git worktrees** so parallel tasks never collide.
- **Docker-based execution** for secure, repeatable runs.
- **Agent control plane** via `agentctl` with start/stop/status and ACP relays.
- **WebSocket-only client API** for real-time orchestration and updates.
- **Approval gates** for sensitive paths and commands.

## How it works (high level)

1. The client opens a single WebSocket connection to the backend.
2. The backend spins up an agent container with `agentctl` as a sidecar.
3. The backend initializes ACP over stdin/stdout and creates a session.
4. The task prompt is streamed to the agent and progress events flow back in real time.
5. Results are reviewed, approved, and merged back into the main branch.
