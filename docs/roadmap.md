# Roadmap

High-level direction for the project. This is not a commitment - priorities shift as we learn more.

## Now

- Stability and bug fixes across all agent integrations
- Improved plan mode - richer plan editing, version history, plan diffs

## Next

- Github integration - link tasks to GitHub issues, PRs
- Workflow templates sharing - import/export workflows
- Mobile-friendly UI - orchestrate and review from your phone
- Remote SSH runtime - run agents on remote servers over SSH
- Linear / Jira integration - sync tasks and workflows with popular project management tools

## Later

- Kubernetes operator - auto-scaling agent workloads in a cluster
- Analytics dashboard - agent performance, cost tracking, success rates
