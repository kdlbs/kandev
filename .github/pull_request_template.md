<!--
AGENT INSTRUCTIONS — read this before filling in the template below.

Generate each section using the rules below. Remove a section entirely if it adds no value for the size of the change. Remove all agent instruction comments from the final output.

SUMMARY (required)
  1–2 sentences max. Do not include a "Summary" heading — write directly as prose.
  Lead with the problem or goal, end with the outcome.
  Say WHY, not what. No filler phrases ("This PR...", "In order to...", "As part of...").

IMPORTANT CHANGES (optional)
  Include only for significant architectural changes. Skip for small or straightforward changes.
  Very short bullet list. Each bullet says WHAT changed and why (very short).

VALIDATION (required)
  How this was tested or verified. List commands or checks run (e.g. `go test ./...`, `make lint`).

DIAGRAM (optional)
  Include a Mermaid diagram only when it genuinely helps the reader understand a non-obvious flow,
  architecture change, or component relationship. Skip if the change is self-explanatory.

POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS (optional)
  One line: risk level + what could go wrong or be improved. Skip if negligible.

RELATED ISSUES
  Use "Closes #N" if this resolves an issue. Remove the line if there is no related issue.

RULES
  - Do not add "🤖 Generated with..." or any tool attribution footer.
  - Do not leave placeholder text or unfilled sections in the output.
  - Render the final PR body without any of these instruction comments.
  - Always keep the Checklist section as-is; do not remove or pre-fill its items.
